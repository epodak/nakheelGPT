An anonymous customer gave a 3 star rating for 'Nakheel Mall' on June 2022 and said the nakheel mall is a fashionable mall located in the midst of the palm jumeirah the parking and elevator systems are far above average the issue for this mall apart from those that live in the palm area is finding a reason to go here given the competition from other famous malls in the city nakheel has restaurants with spectacular views and excellent healthy food restaurants if like me you treasure an uncrowded and easy access parking system thats also a plus but the mall needs more businesses and better information about whats available the website is slow and the chat service gets back to you if you have a question i like this mall but it has a long way to go to reach its potential

An anonymous customer gave a 1 star rating for 'Nakheel Mall' on December 2022 and said guys do not step foot in this place recently my brother had a disturbing experience at the mall where he was beaten up and attacked despite the presence of mall security and employees he was not provided with any assistance or support when he needed it most in fact only one person stood up for him and helped him out of the situation and he was only a visitor  i am particularly concerned that my brother was alone and outnumbered by a group of seven individuals during this incident it is unacceptable that he was not given the help and support he needed when he was in distress and outnumbered  i understand that mall security and employees may not be able to prevent every potential incident but it is essential that they are prepared to respond appropriately and effectively when such situations do arise i strongly encourage you to review and improve the safety and security protocols at nakheel mall to ensure that all customers feel safe and supported while visiting the mall

An anonymous customer gave a 1 star rating for 'The View' on January 2023 and said absolutely disastrous experience they do not follow time on your ticket you will still be put in a general line no matter what time your ticket states it takes forever for them to move the line as there is absolutely no organization ticket checker entertains every random persons question delaying efficient movement of the line it took us almost hours to reach the deck one thing which is rarely mentioned anywhere that the demonstration about history etc is mandatory before you are taken to the deck it is not an optional thing so if you planning for a sunset view do not buy tickets closer to sunset timing your prime tickets will be waste of money then the history part was nothing specific everything was generic which can be found online night views from this place are ordinary at the best most of the island at night is too dark to appreciate the beauty all in all it was a waste of money effort and experience for us we expected a better experience from this worldclass attraction

An anonymous customer gave a 1 star rating for 'The View' on January 2023 and said first you queue up for minutes for the tickets then you wait again minutes to enter the exhibition queue up again like minutes for the elevator you are not allowed to take stroller with you so you have to carry your child the whole time while you are just standing and waiting on your way down you must wait again for the elevator really bad organised we have expected so much more

An anonymous customer gave a 1 star rating for 'The View' on October 2022 and said we paid to watch the view during the sunset ticket more expensive than the others but we were unaware that we had to wait at least an hour in line inside for an exorbitant price result the view of an island wasted due to the darkness which prevented us from seeing the shapes of the palm tree as well as an oppressive staff seeking to get you in quickly without ever warning you of the waiting time or that it was too late to be able to observe the sunset to then tell you that the queue was to be expected and that since the tickets have been scanned it is not possible to postpone the experience very disappointing experience so i wanted to warn everyone who wants to try to see this view that to be able to fully enjoy it do not hesitate to arrive well in advance also dont expect to be able to see the entire palm tree although we overlook this island you will never be able to take photos with the entire palm tree

An anonymous customer gave a 4 star rating for 'The View' on September 2022 and said overall its has a magnificent view of the whole palm and a good place to enjoy the view i just dont like the big metal or glass i think its for the support of the wall but you couldnt be able to take the whole palm in the picture i think there still need improvement to make the view more interesting
An anonymous customer gave a 5 star rating for 'The View' on September 2022 and said i recommend there is a great view of the palm tree and the city from the top in addition the introduction prepared is interesting because first we get a film displayed on the floor with information about the palm tree and in the next room another short film about building a palm tree during the entire introduction you can learn about the history and construction of the palm tree it is possible to go to the roof of the building then your view is not limited by the glass but you can still see this protection from above and it spoils the photos a bit night shots do not reflect the view with your own eyes i recommend

An anonymous customer gave a 5 star rating for 'The View' on November 2022 and said recommended in my opinion the views are better than that of burj khalifa buying tickets online are better and cheaper entry is through nakheel mall monorail stn nd floor itself there is small show and mini musuem kind of which gives information about the inception and construction phases of the palm jumeriah there are less crowds so you can click photos and enjoy the views comfortably

An anonymous customer gave a 5 star rating for 'The View' on May 2022 and said nice view of palm jumeriah from here but really not worth the money we paid if youd like to enjoy your visit then go here during the morning hours because it starts to get busy during afternoon hours  there is a rooftop restaurant that charged aed for water so better carry your water bottle lol  we did ended up going to the top most level as we had vip tickets even though we went here in february it was still quite hot to be out in the sun so consider the weather before planing the trip

An anonymous customer gave a 4 star rating for 'The View' on May 2022 and said it could be nice if we went on a right day we visited on a sand storm day so the view was very limited and not good my advice would be wait until the day you want to visit and go you can get the tickets at the entrance it wasnt busy the day we visited the place during the week end it can get very busythe entrance is inside the nakeel mall so better look for the signs also when you buy tickets double check whether you can change it if things didnt go as you want

An anonymous customer gave a 2 star rating for 'The View' on November 2022 and said dont book the vip its a complete rip off go with the fast track instead which gives you the same things for less  the private tour guide kept asking us if we want to skip rooms while going up  the security guard named azif was very unfriendly and kept bothering us with conflicting instructions while we were taking pictures at th floor  finally the lounge which we paid for was exclusively booked by a group of people for a private celebration and we were asked to wait an hour for them to finish  we asked if we could at least take the champagne glass and walk with it on th while enjoying the view and got denied and told we need to wait  if they have a group scheduled they shouldnt allow people to book tickets for the lounge  overall for almost per person quite a disappointing experience

An anonymous customer gave a 5 star rating for 'The View' on April 2022 and said a new and different point of view from the others from here you have a degree view of the whole palm island you can see every aspect of the work and if you go there at sunset it is really beautiful you can choose to go up on two different levels but is it worth it to go up to the higher level yes for two reasons the first of course is that you go higher on a less frequented terrace and the other is that before going up you can also have an aperitif with champagne and enjoy the view in an airconditioned lounge it is a mustsee observation point to enjoy something that you could not see until very recently the whole palm island from above as if you were a drone in flight with music in the background if you want a few floors below you could access the infinity pool on the sides of the tower but from above it is much better

An anonymous customer gave a 5 star rating for 'The View' on December 2022 and said i was here yesterday its a beautiful place the views are stunning the staff are really friendly and helpful and the whole experience is great it is much more than just a view i really enjoyed the interactive bits the build up and the information that was given before you go up to the top so interesting to learn about the island and the details of how it was built etc its all so impressive interesting and well worth the visit what i enjoyed even more and was so impressed with was the fact it was a good level of busy not crazy busy like some other observation towers i have been too there was no queueing for long at all only a few minutes for the lift to arrive to go up or down and no challenge to get a picture and nice view at the top through crowds of people i bought my tickets on arrival as it was a lastminute decision that we stumbled upon there were no issues but it may be worth prebooking tickets to avoid disappointment or unnecessary travel i spent a few hours here just enjoying the experience i could have spent longer if i didnt have other plans we also had photos taken at the top the photographer was great and very accommodating my only criticism is the pictures are a little bit pricey even for digital format but it was not a surprise its on par with other tourist attractions photos and there is no pressure or obligation to buy or even take photos we had asked specifically for ones at the top as not a big fan of the green screen photos but again everywhere seems to do these green screen ones now rather than take advantage of the fact you are already at a place with beautiful views to take a real picture that being said it was a better one than others i have had so being a tourist i had to have that one too highly recommend the view at the palm

An anonymous customer gave a 4 star rating for 'The View' on December 2022 and said it is a nice post to see the palm etc it does get busy and that ruins the experience a bit because a lot of people just casualy walk in front of you and in the middle of photo  it pays off to get the fast track because there is usually only one lift max two that operate and it fits only people maximum so the wait can be really long there is a coffee shop and a souvenire shop although its pricy all in all i would recommend because it does give a great view of the whole palm ain dubai burj al arab

An anonymous customer gave a 3 star rating for 'The View' on April 2022 and said the view  cafe boon  hospitality  dei photo company   our trip started with very polite staff greeting us followed by a welcome picture then got some more pics clicked at the top with the view of the palm enjoyed a relaxing evening at the amazing boon cafe we had the best time ever captured great memories we even purchased our pictures clicked by the professionals at the top and were under the impression that the welcome pictures would also be a part of it even if they were not we didnt mind because we purchased aed worth of picture pack from the top but to our shock at the souvenir shop on the ground floor when we were exiting two people from the photo company rushed to us with two welcome pictures which were printed already by them and placed on their shelf for purchase one was a family pic and the other of my one and a half year old daughter out on public display costing each usually welcome pics are displayed on the screen and not printed we as a family do spend money on these pics but this has never happened before no one has ever printed them except if we wish to purchase i just bought the family one and had to let go of my daughters pic asking them to discard it because we had already spent quite a lot on the picsthe worst part is knowing that my daughters pic is printed with them and will be thrown in the bin yes we are sensitive about these things when it comes to our daughter as am sure are other parents my only suggestion is please do not print prior to the customer selecting and wishing to take the pics

An anonymous customer gave a 1 star rating for 'The View' on December 2022 and said do not come to this place during the high season at sunset time it will take you around h after long tiresome queues to see the palm and it will be dark by then i bought the tickets h in advance and arrived hmin before sunset time the company is very disorganized and probably oversold tickets to make more money sunset tickets are more expensive than nonsunset tickets in sum it is a scam trying to get my money back

An anonymous customer gave a 5 star rating for 'The View' on April 2022 and said so we planned to see the plam from the above the sky and booked the fast track next level view the best part about it was that with this type of ticket you will become a kind of vip fast track and will be everywhere first in the line etc which was good as there were a lot of people standing in line nevertheless it took them also not very much longer to get to the elevator  secondly the view from the next level is much better as there are no metal frames windows etc which may interact with your pictures and the view of course is much better then  we booked through the service of our hotel and the price was the same as we would have booked via the main website of the plam view after the view we went shopping and connected the experience with the visit of madinat jumeirah which was a pretty good fit as it was not that far away  it was important for us to see the sundown from above so we went up at around pm normally they say you can stay only for minutes but we were around hour at the top of the view and could should also the palm while the sun was going down but also the palm by night was a great experience  we needed masks not while taking pictures on the top level and couldnt bring our backpack with us so had to carry our camera and lenses in our hands and keep the backpack in the secure lockers in the lobby in front of the entry it was free of charge

An anonymous customer gave a 4 star rating for 'The View' on November 2022 and said view at the palm jumeirah dubai dubai is an architectural paradise teeming with skyscrapers like beams of shimmering light its a strict mix of the shiny glass skyscrapers versus the traditional arabic beige brown ones with moorish touches the new world skyscrapers each face stiff competition at a risk of fading into oblivion of the multitude its truly hard to stand out burj khalifa is the tallest in the world and truly iconic but creating an island from sand scratch into the sea is a feat of a different engineering kind view at the palm gives you a birds eye view of the stunning palm atlantis and burj al arab you can easily spend half a day here if not for the blistering sun this is my favourite view spot theres so much to take in beaches architecture everyday life that goes on down there iconic buildings etc to get here take the monorail from jumeirah monorail station to nakheel mall its less crowded than the burj khalifa phew eatstylishtravelstylish
