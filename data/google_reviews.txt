1 star rating for 'The View' on January 2023 and google review: the view and the place itself was amazing i am rating star due to an experience i had with one of the cleaning staffwe travelled from the uk on th we visited this place on st jan we had booked the fast track tickets and the view from level everything was perfect there was no waiting time the staff were friendly before getting out at around pm my yr old girl wanted to use the facilities so we went to the washroom on the right walking down from level and had the most bizarre experience when we got out of the toilet booth the cleaning lady standing outside shook her head in disgust then she started blocking us wherever we went under the pretence of cleaning she would not let me or my girl wash our hands i ignored her as i assumed she was stressed from work i excused my self to be able to get some space to use the hand wash when my yr old could not get the sensor activated with her little hands this lady again shook her head in disgust and sweared under her breath at this point i wanted to get out of the place asap but my little one wanted to use the hand towels when we started approaching the towel dispenser the cleaning lady promptly went ahead of us and blocked us pulled a no of towels and started to clean the towel dispenser i had to excuse myself to be able to reach the dispenser again there was this look of disgust like she was dealing with some rodent the moment i pulled a towel she promptly blocked me again by now i was sure this was not just work stress so i stopped a couple mins to observe her behaviour while drying our hands then i noticed we were the only ones that she was rude to she was extremely friendly to all the others in the washroom smiling and handing out hand towels that‚Äôs when i also noticed we were the only coloured ones in the washroomi did not want to confront her and ruin our day so i left quietly but i strongly believe this women needs to be educated it is not ok to treat someone differently who she believes is ‚Äòinferior‚Äô to her i hope the message gets passed dubai is a wonderful place safe and tourist friendly i hope people like her don‚Äôt ruin that experience

5 star rating for 'The View' on December 2022 and google review: i was here yesterday its a beautiful place the views are stunning the staff are really friendly and helpful and the whole experience is great it is much more than just a view i really enjoyed the interactive bits the build up and the information that was given before you go up to the top so interesting to learn about the island and the details of how it was built etc its all so impressive interesting and well worth the visit what i enjoyed even more and was so impressed with was the fact it was a good level of busy not crazy busy like some other observation towers i have been too there was no queueing for long at all only a few minutes for the lift to arrive to go up or down and no challenge to get a picture and nice view at the top through crowds of people i bought my tickets on arrival as it was a lastminute decision that we stumbled upon there were no issues but it may be worth prebooking tickets to avoid disappointment or unnecessary travel i spent a few hours here just enjoying the experience i could have spent longer if i didnt have other plans we also had photos taken at the top the photographer was great and very accommodating my only criticism is the pictures are a little bit pricey even for digital format but it was not a surprise its on par with other tourist attractions photos and there is no pressure or obligation to buy or even take photos we had asked specifically for ones at the top as not a big fan of the green screen photos but again everywhere seems to do these green screen ones now rather than take advantage of the fact you are already at a place with beautiful views to take a real picture that being said it was a better one than others i have had so being a tourist i had to have that one too highly recommend the view at the palm

1 star rating for 'The View' on October 2022 and google review: we paid to watch the view during the sunset ticket more expensive than the others but we were unaware that we had to wait at least an hour in line inside for an exorbitant price result the view of an island wasted due to the darkness which prevented us from seeing the shapes of the palm tree as well as an oppressive staff seeking to get you in quickly without ever warning you of the waiting time or that it was too late to be able to observe the sunset to then tell you that the queue was to be expected and that since the tickets have been scanned it is not possible to postpone the experience very disappointing experience so i wanted to warn everyone who wants to try to see this view that to be able to fully enjoy it do not hesitate to arrive well in advance also dont expect to be able to see the entire palm tree although we overlook this island you will never be able to take photos with the entire palm tree

4 star rating for 'Souk Al Marfa' on August 2022 and google review: the market is beautiful and there are many different shops and there is a part of the market called the thai market and its atmosphere suggests that you are in one of the popular thailand markets the shops and products in it are all from thailand and after the thai restaurants offer the original thai food because those who work are all thais i advise those who love thai food do not miss eating from these restaurants are reasonably priced

3 star rating for 'Nakheel Mall' on June 2022 and google review: the nakheel mall is a fashionable mall located in the midst of the palm jumeirah the parking and elevator systems are far above average the issue for this mall apart from those that live in the palm area is finding a reason to go here given the competition from other famous malls in the city nakheel has restaurants with spectacular views and excellent healthy food restaurants if like me you treasure an uncrowded and easy access parking system that‚Äôs also a plus but the mall needs more businesses and better information about what‚Äôs available the website is slow and the chat service ‚Äògets back to you‚Äô if you have a question i like this mall but it has a long way to go to reach it‚Äôs potential

1 star rating for 'Ibn Battuta Mall' on June 2022 and google review: ibn batuta mall is very good and excellent but the lower staff and security behaviour is very rude they need conversation skills training yesterday i visited the carrefour as a temporary merchandiser but the one dph superviser insulted me i bear miss conduct of him even he abused me and use bad words he is the black sheep in the society i urge to the management to train the lower staff to talk politely with suppliers and merchandisers like a human being such staff members are destroying the reputation of huge mall other all aspects of carrefour are appropriated the customer service is very efficient im sure the management will kook forward to the very serious issue thanks and regards mehran ejaz

4 star rating for 'Nakheel Mall' on June 2022 and google review: lovely mall with nice spacious feel and luxurious feel contains some amazing water fountains inside as well as a plethora of dining options to choose from there is food courts the regular food court with the usual fast food options which is beautiful i must say perfect place to grab a bite to eat and catch up on some work there is also the depachika food hall which is a more niche luxurious food hall with bespoke coffee local businesses selling items like patisseries mochi smoothies japanese foods a cheese room etc it is exquisite there are also lots of restaurants on the main area of floor the supermarket waitrose is also fab with an extensive array of choice in the deli counter this mall also has a lot of activities to offer there is a cinema a trampoline park an arcadeamusement centre and last but certainly not least there is the view only downfall of this mall is that there is a lack of popular clothing shops and no department store if you are looking to go on a shopping spree and buy a whole new wardrobe this is definitely not the mall for that but it‚Äôs perfect for everything else if it just added a zara bershka pullbear etc it would be my favourite mall

1 star rating for 'Souk Al Marfa' on May 2022 and google review: this place is good for minute free ferry ride from old baladiya street deira tourist footfall is almost negligible one could practically feel the disappointment on shopkeepers and restaurants owners face because of lack of business some open shops has no one to attend too entry to the souq is blocked with toilets and storerooms which is a negative point inside souq walkable area is narrow limited people who visit the souq almost never visit the inside of the main structure which is deserted wifi connectivity is low to poor outside the souq area deira island is empty big deira mall construction is stopped for unknown reason buses and ferry connectivity needs to be improved  all in all nakheel management who manages this souq needs revamp immediately

5 star rating for 'The View' on April 2022 and google review: so we planned to see the plam from the above the sky and booked the fast track next level view the best part about it was that with this type of ticket you will become a kind of vip fast track and will be everywhere first in the line etc which was good as there were a lot of people standing in line nevertheless it took them also not very much longer to get to the elevator  secondly the view from the next level is much better as there are no metal frames windows etc which may interact with your pictures and the view of course is much better then  we booked through the service of our hotel and the price was the same as we would have booked via the main website of the plam view after the view we went shopping and connected the experience with the visit of madinat jumeirah which was a pretty good fit as it was not that far away  it was important for us to see the sundown from above so we went up at around pm normally they say you can stay only for minutes but we were around hour at the top of the view and could should also the palm while the sun was going down but also the palm by night was a great experience  we needed masks not while taking pictures on the top level and couldnt bring our backpack with us so had to carry our camera and lenses in our hands and keep the backpack in the secure lockers in the lobby in front of the entry it was free of charge

5 star rating for 'The View' on April 2022 and google review: a new and different point of view from the others from here you have a degree view of the whole palm island you can see every aspect of the work and if you go there at sunset it is really beautiful you can choose to go up on two different levels but is it worth it to go up to the higher level yes for two reasons the first of course is that you go higher on a less frequented terrace and the other is that before going up you can also have an aperitif with champagne and enjoy the view in an airconditioned lounge it is a mustsee observation point to enjoy something that you could not see until very recently the whole palm island from above as if you were a drone in flight with music in the background if you want a few floors below you could access the infinity pool on the sides of the tower but from above it is much better
